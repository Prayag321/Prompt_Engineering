Everything from the fit comfort, design, sound quality, and value, this is thing is on a different level. It has dual Dynamic Drivers (ie., the thing that makes sound in your earphones- this one has two in each side) that produce crisp, beautiful sounds that will definitely scratch an itch in your brain you didnt know was there. Pair it with a DAC (even something cheap like Abigail pro) for optimum performance. You will not regret this buy.|
